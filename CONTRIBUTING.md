### ðŸ”– Steps to Contribute

Following are the steps to guide you to making your own fork of the MDF repository, making changes and submitting them as contributions:

* Step 1: [Fork the MDF repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo), go to your terminal and clone it on your machine.
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/<your fork>/MDF
    ```

* Step 2: Add a upstream link to main branch in your cloned repo
    ```
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ModECI/MDF.git
    ```
* Step 3: Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (this will also avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes)
    ```
    git pull upstream main https://github.com/ModECI/MDF.git
    ```
* Step 4: Create your feature branch (This is a necessary step in order to avoid any disorder in main branch (e.g. bugfix/22))
    ```
    git checkout -b <feature-name>
    ```
* Step 5: Commit all the changes
    ```
    git commit -m "A meaningful but small commit message"
    ```
* Step 6: Push the changes to your fork
    ```
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
* Step 7: Create a PR on Github.
     - Don't just hit the create a pull request button, you should write a PR message to clarify why and what are you contributing.
     - Put the hashtag of a relevant issue in a commit message for the pull request, and it will show up in the issue itself which will make easy for developers to review your PR based on the issue.
