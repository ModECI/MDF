This is the First task of my Outreachy/MDF contribution. This project involves creating a model with a graph which contains three connected nodes. Each of this node should have a unique mathematical expression, a condition and or a time derivative. In this notebook, i created a model with 3 connected nodes with each node containing its own mathematical expression. I also created different condition for execution of each nodes and the graph of the model was also generated. The model was then serialized in Json and YAML file format.
