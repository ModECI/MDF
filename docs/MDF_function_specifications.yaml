onnx::BatchNormalization:
    description: '

        Carries out batch normalization as described in the paper

        https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167. Depending on the mode it is being run,

        There are five required inputs ''X'', ''scale'', ''B'', ''input_mean'' and

        ''input_var''.

        Note that ''input_mean'' and ''input_var'' are expected to be the estimated

        statistics in inference mode (training_mode=False, default),

        and the running statistics in training mode (training_mode=True).

        There are multiple cases for the number of outputs, which we list below:


        * Output case #1: Y, running_mean, running_var (training_mode=True)

        * Output case #2: Y (training_mode=False)


        When training_mode=False, extra outputs are invalid.

        The outputs are updated as follows when training_mode=True:

        ```

        running_mean = input_mean * momentum + current_mean * (1 - momentum)

        running_var = input_var * momentum + current_var * (1 - momentum)


        Y = (X - current_mean) / sqrt(current_var + epsilon) * scale + B

        ```

        where:

        ```

        current_mean = ReduceMean(X, axis=all_except_channel_index)

        current_var =  ReduceVar(X, axis=all_except_channel_index)

        ```

        Notice that `ReduceVar` refers to the population variance, and it equals to

        `sum(sqrd(x_i - x_avg)) / N`

        where `N` is the population size (this formula does not use sample size `N
        - 1`).


        The computation of ReduceMean and ReduceVar uses float to avoid overflow for
        float16 inputs.


        When training_mode=False:

        ```

        Y = (X - input_mean) / sqrt(input_var + epsilon) * scale + B

        ```


        For previous (depreciated) non-spatial cases, implementors are suggested

        to flatten the input shape to (N x C * D1 * D2 * ... * Dn) before a BatchNormalization
        Op.

        This operator has **optional** inputs/outputs. See [the doc](IR.md) for more

    description: '

        Bitwise shift operator performs element-wise operation. For each input element,
        if the

        attribute "direction" is "RIGHT", this operator moves its binary representation
        toward

        the right side so that the input value is effectively decreased. If the attribute
        "direction"

        is "LEFT", bits of binary representation moves toward the left side, which
        results the

        increase of its actual value. The input X is the tensor to be shifted and
        another input

        Y specifies the amounts of shifting. For example, if "direction" is "Right",
        X is [1, 4],

        and S is [1, 1], the corresponding output Z would be [0, 2]. If "direction"
        is "LEFT" with

        X=[1, 2] and S=[1, 2], the corresponding output Y would be [2, 8].


        Because this operator supports Numpy-style broadcasting, X''s and Y''s shapes
        are

        not necessarily identical.

        \ numeric representations\n(e.g., \"1e-5\" and \"1E8\") to float types is\
        \ supported. For example, converting string \"100.5\" to an integer may\n\
        yield result 100. There are some string literals reserved for special floating-point\
        \ values;\n\"+INF\" (and \"INF\"), \"-INF\", and \"NaN\" are positive infinity,\

onnx::Einsum:
    description: '

        An einsum of the form `term1, term2 -> output-term` produces an output tensor
        using the following equation


        ```

        output[output-term] = reduce-sum( input1[term1] * input2[term2] )

        ```


        where the reduce-sum performs a summation over all the indices occurring in
        the input terms (term1, term2)

        that do not occur in the output-term.


        The Einsum operator evaluates algebraic tensor operations on a sequence of
        tensors, using the Einstein summation

        convention. The equation string contains a comma-separated sequence of lower
        case letters. Each term corresponds to

        an operand tensor, and the characters within the terms correspond to operands
        dimensions.


        This sequence may be followed by "->" to separate the left and right hand
        side of the equation.

        If the equation contains "->" followed by the right-hand side, the explicit
        (not classical) form of the Einstein

        summation is performed, and the right-hand side indices indicate output tensor
        dimensions. In other cases,

        output indices are (implicitly) set to the alphabetically sorted sequence
        of indices appearing exactly once in the

        equation.


        When a dimension character is repeated in the left-hand side, it represents
        summation along the dimension.


        The equation may contain ellipsis ("...") to enable broadcasting. Ellipsis
        must indicate a fixed number of dimensions.

        Specifically, every occurrence of ellipsis in the equation must represent
        the same number of dimensions.

        The right-hand side may contain exactly one ellipsis. In implicit mode, the
        ellipsis dimensions are set to the

        beginning of the output. The equation string may contain space (U+0020) character.

        \ `data` into an output tensor of rank `q + r - indices_shape[-1] - 1 - b`.\n\
        \n`indices` is an q-dimensional integer tensor, best thought of as a `(q-1)`-dimensional\
        \ tensor of index-tuples into `data`,\nwhere each element defines a slice\

        \ from the `b+1` dimension.\n\nSome salient points about the inputs' rank\
        \ and shape:\n\n1) r >= 1 and q >= 1 are to be honored. There is no dependency\
        \ condition to be met between ranks `r` and `q`\n\n2) The first `b` dimensions\
        \ of the shape of `indices` tensor and `data` tensor must be equal.\n\n3)\
        \ b < min(q, r) is to be honored.\n\n4) The `indices_shape[-1]` should have\
        \ a value between 1 (inclusive) and rank `r-b` (inclusive)\n\n5) All values\
        \ in `indices` are expected to be within bounds [-s, s-1] along axis of size\
        \ `s` (i.e.) `-data_shape[i] <= indices[...,i] <= data_shape[i] - 1`.\n  \
        \ It is an error if any of the index values are out of bounds.\n\nThe output\
        \ is computed as follows:\n\nThe output tensor is obtained by mapping each\
        \ index-tuple in the `indices` tensor to the corresponding slice of the input\
        \ `data`.\n\n1) If `indices_shape[-1] > r-b` => error condition\n\n2) If `indices_shape[-1]\
        \ == r-b`, since the rank of `indices` is `q`, `indices` can be thought of\
        \ as `N` `(q-b-1)`-dimensional tensors\n   containing 1-D tensors of dimension\
        \ `r-b`, where `N` is an integer equals to the product of 1 and all the elements\
        \ in the batch dimensions\n   of the indices_shape. Let us think of each such\
        \ `r-b` ranked tensor as `indices_slice`. Each *scalar value* corresponding\
        \ to `data[0:b-1,indices_slice]`\n   is filled into the corresponding location\
        \ of the `(q-b-1)`-dimensional tensor to form the `output` tensor (Example\
        \ 1 below)\n\n3) If `indices_shape[-1] < r-b`, since the rank of `indices`\
        \ is `q`, `indices` can be thought of as `N` `(q-b-1)`-dimensional tensor\n\
        \   containing 1-D tensors of dimension `< r-b`. Let us think of each such\

        The convolution operator consumes a quantized input tensor, its scale and
        zero point,

        a quantized filter, its scale and zero point, and output''s scale and zero
        point,

        and computes the quantized output. Each scale and zero-point pair must have
        same shape.

        It means they must be either scalars (per tensor) or 1-D tensors (per output
        channel).

        Each input or output and its related zero point must have same type.

        When bias is present it must be quantized using scale = input scale * weight
        scale and

        zero point as 0.

onnx::QLinearMatMul:
    description: '

        Matrix product that behaves like numpy.matmul: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.13.0/reference/generated/numpy.matmul.html.

        It consumes two quantized input tensors, their scales and zero points, scale
        and zero point of output,

        and computes the quantized output. The quantization formula is y = saturate((x
        / y_scale) + y_zero_point).

        For (x / y_scale), it is rounding to nearest ties to even. Refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding
        for details.

        Scale and zero point must have same shape. They must be either scalar (per
        tensor) or N-D tensor

        (per row for ''a'' and per column for ''b''). Scalar refers to per tensor
        quantization whereas N-D refers to per row

        or per column quantization. If the input is 2D of shape [M, K] then zero point
        and scale tensor may be

        an M element vector [v_1, v_2, ..., v_M] for per row quantization and K element
        vector of shape [v_1, v_2, ..., v_K]

        Region of Interest (RoI) align operation described in the

        [Mask R-CNN paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06870).

        RoiAlign consumes an input tensor X and region of interests (rois)

        to apply pooling across each RoI; it produces a 4-D tensor of shape

        (num_rois, C, output_height, output_width).


        RoiAlign is proposed to avoid the misalignment by removing

        quantizations while converting from original image into feature

        map and from feature map into RoI feature; in each ROI bin,

        the value of the sampled locations are computed directly

        through bilinear interpolation.

        Round takes one input Tensor and rounds the values, element-wise, meaning

        If input x is integral, +0, -0, NaN,  or infinite, x itself is returned.

        The output tensor has the same shape and type as the input.

onnx::TfIdfVectorizer:
    description: '

        This transform extracts n-grams from the input sequence and save them as a
        vector. Input can

        be either a 1-D or 2-D tensor. For 1-D input, output is the n-gram representation
        of that input.

        For 2-D input, the output is also a  2-D tensor whose i-th row is the n-gram
        representation of the i-th input row.

        More specifically, if input shape is [C], the corresponding output shape would
        be [max(ngram_indexes) + 1].

        If input shape is [N, C], this operator produces a [N, max(ngram_indexes)
        + 1]-tensor.


        In contrast to standard n-gram extraction, here, the indexes of extracting
        an n-gram from the original

        sequence are not necessarily consecutive numbers. The discontinuity between
        indexes are controlled by the number of skips.

        If the number of skips is 2, we should skip two tokens when scanning through
        the original sequence.

        Let''s consider an example. Assume that input sequence is [94, 17, 36, 12,
        28] and the number of skips is 2.

        The associated 2-grams are [94, 12] and [17, 28] respectively indexed by [0,
        3] and [1, 4].

        If the number of skips becomes 0, the 2-grams generated are [94, 17], [17,
        36], [36, 12], [12, 28]

        indexed by [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], respectively.


        The output vector (denoted by Y) stores the count of each n-gram;

        Y[ngram_indexes[i]] indicates the times that the i-th n-gram is found. The
        attribute ngram_indexes is used to determine the mapping

        between index i and the corresponding n-gram''s output coordinate. If pool_int64s
        is [94, 17, 17, 36], ngram_indexes is [1, 0],

        ngram_counts=[0, 0], then the Y[0] (first element in Y) and Y[1] (second element
        in Y) are the counts of [17, 36] and [94, 17],

        respectively. An n-gram which cannot be found in pool_strings/pool_int64s
        should be ignored and has no effect on the output.

        Note that we may consider all skips up to S when generating the n-grams.


        The examples used above are true if mode is "TF". If mode is "IDF", all the
        counts larger than 1 would be truncated to 1 and

        the i-th element in weights would be used to scale (by multiplication) the
        count of the i-th n-gram in pool. If mode is "TFIDF",

        this operator first computes the counts of all n-grams and then scale them
        by the associated values in the weights attribute.


        Only one of pool_strings and pool_int64s can be set. If pool_int64s is set,
        the input should be an integer tensor.

        If pool_strings is set, the input must be a string tensor.
