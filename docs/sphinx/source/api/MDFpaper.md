# Paper introducing MDF

The background to the ModECI project, the motivation for developing the Model Description Format, and the initial Python implementation of the language have been described in a NeuroView article in the Neuron journal:

*<b>Integrating model development across computational neuroscience, cognitive science, and machine learning</b>*
Padraig Gleeson, Sharon Crook, David Turner, Katherine Mantel, Mayank Raunak, Ted Willke and Jonathan D. Cohen, April 25, 2023 DOI: [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.03.037](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2023.03.037)

*Neuroscience, cognitive science, and computer science are increasingly benefiting through their interactions. This could be accelerated by direct sharing of computational models across disparate modeling software used in each. We describe a Model Description Format designed to meet this challenge.*
