Its output shape\nis the same as the shape of `data`. Note that `indices` should not have duplicate entries.\nThat is, two or more `updates` for the same index-location is not supported.\n\n`indices` is an integer tensor. Let k denote indices.shape[-1], the last dimension in the shape of `indices`.\n `indices` is treated as a (q-1)-dimensional tensor of k-tuples, where each k-tuple is a partial-index into `data`.\nHence, k can be a value at most the rank of `data`. When k equals rank(data), each update entry specifies an\nupdate to a single element of the tensor. When k is less than rank(data) each update entry specifies an\nupdate to a slice of the tensor.\n\n`updates` is treated as a (q-1)-dimensional tensor of replacement-slice-values. Thus, the\nfirst (q-1) dimensions of updates.shape must match the first (q-1) dimensions of indices.shape.\nThe remaining dimensions of `updates` correspond to the dimensions of the\nreplacement-slice-values. Each replacement-slice-value is a (r-k) dimensional tensor,\ncorresponding to the trailing (r-k) dimensions of `data`.  Thus, the shape of `updates`\nmust equal indices.shape[0:q-1] ++ data.shape[k:r-1], where ++ denotes the concatenation\nof shapes.\n\nThe `output` is calculated via the following equation:\n\n    output = np.copy(data)\n    update_indices = indices.shape[:-1]\n    for idx in np.ndindex(update_indices):\n        output[indices[idx]] = updates[idx]\n\nThe order of iteration in the above loop is not specified.\nIn particular, indices should not have duplicate entries: that is, if idx1 != idx2, then indices[idx1] != indices[idx2].\nThis ensures that the output value does not depend on the iteration order.\n\nThis operator is the inverse of GatherND.\n\nExample 1:\n```\n  data    = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n  indices = [[4], [3], [1], [7]]\n  updates = [9, 10, 11, 12]\n  output  = [1, 11, 3, 10, 9, 6, 7, 12]\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\n  data    = [[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]],\n             [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]],\n             [[8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]],\n             [[8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]]\n  indices = [[0], [2]]\n  updates = [[[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],\n             [[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4]]]\n  output  = [[[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],\n             [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]],\n             [[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4]],\n             [[8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]]\n```\n",

The discontinuity between indexes are controlled by the number of skips.\nIf the number of skips is 2, we should skip two tokens when scanning through the original sequence.\nLet's consider an example. Assume that input sequence is [94, 17, 36, 12, 28] and the number of skips is 2.\nThe associated 2-grams are [94, 12] and [17, 28] respectively indexed by [0, 3] and [1, 4].\nIf the number of skips becomes 0, the 2-grams generated are [94, 17], [17, 36], [36, 12], [12, 28]\nindexed by [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], respectively.\n\nThe output vector (denoted by Y) stores the count of each n-gram;\nY[ngram_indexes[i]] indicates the times that the i-th n-gram is found.

An n-gram which cannot be found in pool_strings/pool_int64s should be ignored and has no effect on the output.\nNote that we may consider all skips up to S when generating the n-grams.\n\nThe examples used above are true if mode is \"TF\".

Pooling\n the result of an unpooling operation should give back the original input to the unpooling op.\n\nMaxUnpool can produce the same output size for several input sizes, which makes unpooling op ambiguous.\n The third input argument, output_size, is meant to disambiguate the op and produce output tensor of\n known/predictable size.\n\nIn addition to the inputs, MaxUnpool takes three attributes, namely kernel_shape, strides, and pads,\n which define the exact unpooling op. The attributes typically have the same values as the corrsponding\n pooling op that the unpooling op is trying to invert.\n",

        "description": "\nScan can be used to iterate over one or more scan_input tensors,\nconstructing zero or more scan_output tensors. It combines ideas from general recurrences,\nfunctional programming constructs such as scan, fold, map, and zip and is intended to enable\ngeneralizations of RNN-like constructs for sequence-to-sequence processing.\nOther tensors (referred to as state_variables here) can be used to carry a state\nwhen iterating from one element to another (similar to hidden-state in RNNs, also referred\nto as loop-carried dependences in the context of loops).\nMany common usages involve a single scan_input tensor (where functionality\nsimilar to scan, fold and map can be obtained). When more than one scan_input is used,\na behavior similar to zip is obtained.\n\nThe attribute body must be a graph, specifying the computation to be performed in\nevery iteration. It takes as input the current values of the state_variables and\nthe current iterated element of the scan_inputs. It must return the (updated) values\nof the state_variables and zero or more scan_output_element tensors. The values of the\nscan_output_element tensors are concatenated over all the iterations to produce the\nscan_output values of the scan construct (similar to the concatenated intermediate\nhidden-state values of RNN-like constructs). All the output tensors (state_variables as\nwell as scan_output_element tensors) are required to have the same shape in each iteration\nof the loop (a restriction imposed to enable efficient memory allocation).\n\nNote that the iterated element passed to the body subgraph does not have a sequence\naxis. It will have a rank one less than the rank of the corresponding scan_input.\n\nThe scan operation returns the final values of the state_variables as well as the\nscan_outputs.\n\nThe optional attribute scan_input_directions specifies the direction (forward or backward)\nfor each scan input. If this attribute is omitted, all sequences are scanned in the forward\ndirection. A bidirectional scan may be performed by specifying the same tensor input twice\nin the scan_inputs, once with a forward direction, and once with a backward direction.\n\nThe scan_output of the operation is produced by concatenating the scan_output_element\nvalues produced by the body in each iteration.  The optional attribute scan_output_directions\nspecifies the direction in which scan_output is constructed (by appending or prepending the\nscan_output_element to scan_output in each iteration) for each scan_output. If this attribute\nis omitted, the scan_output_element is appended to the scan_output in each iteration.\n\nThe optional attribute scan_input_axes specifies the axis to be scanned for each scan_input.\nIf omitted, every scan_input will be scanned in axis 0. For example, if axis 0 is the\nbatch axis and axis 1 is the time axis (to be scanned), specify an axis value of 1.\nNote that scanning a non-zero axis may be less efficient than scanning axis zero.\n\nThe optional attribute scan_output_axes specifies the axis along which the scan_outputs\nare accumulated for each scan_output. For example, if axis 1 is the time axis (to be\nscanned) for both inputs and outputs, specify a scan_input axis and scan_output axis\nvalue of 1.\n\nNote that because of the ONNX restriction that only the last parameter of an operator can\nbe variadic, the initial-states and scan-inputs are listed together as one input parameter.\nSimilarly, the final-states and scan-outputs are listed together as one output parameter.\nThe attribute num_scan_inputs indicates the number M of scan-inputs.\n\nThe behavior of\n\n    Scan <\n        num_scan_inputs = m,\n        body = loop-body,\n        scan_input_axes = [axis_1, ..., axis_m]\n    > (init_1, ..., init_n, scan_1, ..., scan_m)\n\nis equivalent to the following pseudo-code:\n\n    // scan_i.shape[axis_i] denotes the (max) sequence-length of scan_i\n    // scan_i.shape[axis_i] is required to be equal to scan_j.shape[axis_j] for all i,j.\n    sequence_length = scan_1.shape[axis_1];\n\n    // initialize state-variables\n    st_1 = init_1; ... st_n = init_n;\n    // initialize scan-output variables: [] denotes an empty tensor\n    scan_out_1 = []; ...; scan_out_k = [];\n    // identify number of iterations:\n\n    // execute loop\n    for (int t = 0; t < sequence_length; ++t) {\n        // generate the scan-input elements: the notation T<axis=k>[t] indicates the sub-tensor\n        // of rank one less than T obtained by indexing T at position t along axis k.\n        si_1 = scan_1<axis=axis_1>[t];\n        ... ;\n        si_m = scan_m<axis=axis_m>[t];\n        // execute loop-body\n        st_1, ..., st_n, so_1, ..., so_k = loop-body(st_1, ..., st_n, si_1, ..., si_m)\n        // accumulate the scan-output elements\n        scan_out_1 = Concat<axis=0>(scan_out_1, so_1); ... ; scan_out_k = Concat<axis=0>(scan_out_k, so_k);\n    }\n\n    return st_1, ..., st_n, scan_out_1, ..., scan_out_k;\n\n*Sample usage: Encoding RNN using a Scan*\n\nThe following example shows how a simple RNN over an input tensor %X, with weight tensor %Wi,\nrecurrence weight tensor %Ri, bias tensors %Wbi and %Rbi, and initial hidden-state %H_0 can\nbe encoded as a ScanLoop.

The loop operation node\n   supplies the input value of the input variable for the first iteration, and\n   returns the output value of the output variable produced by the final\n   iteration.\n3) Scan_output variables are used to implicitly concatenate values computed across\n   all the iterations. In the above example, the value of user_defined_val computed\n   over all iterations are concatenated and returned as the value of user_defined_vals\n   after the loop.\n4) Values created in the body cannot be accessed in the enclosing scope,\n   except using the mechanism described above.\n\nNote that the semantics of this op support \"diagonal\" or \"wavefront\" execution.\n(See Step 3 here for an example:\nhttps://devblogs.nvidia.com/optimizing-recurrent-neural-networks-cudnn-5/).\nFrontends should emit multi-layer RNNs as a series of While operators (with\ntime being the inner looping dimension), with each successive layer consuming\nthe scan_outputs from the previous layer, possibly going through several\npoint-wise operators (e.g. dropout, residual connections, linear layer).\n\nThe input/output of subgraph (produced by loop node) matching is based on order instead of name.
