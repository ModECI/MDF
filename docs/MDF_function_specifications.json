For example, converting string \"100.5\" to an integer may\nyield result 100.

Similarly,\nthis case-insensitive rule is applied to \"INF\" and \"NaN\". When casting from numeric tensors\nto string tensors, plain floating-point representation (such as \"314.15926\") would be used.\nConverting non-numerical-literal string such as \"Hello World!\" is an undefined behavior. Cases\nof converting string representing floating-point arithmetic value, such as \"2.718\", to INT is an undefined behavior.\n\nConversion from a numerical type to any numerical type is always allowed.\nUser must be aware of precision loss and value change caused by range difference between two types.\nFor example, a 64-bit float 3.1415926459 may be round to a 32-bit float 3.141592. Similarly, converting\nan integer 36 to Boolean may produce 1 because we truncate bits which can't be stored in the targeted type.\n\nIn more detail, the conversion among numerical types should follow these rules:\n\n* Casting from floating point to:\n  * floating point: +/- infinity if OOR (out of range).\n  * fixed point: undefined if OOR.\n  * bool: +/- 0.0 to False; all else to True.\n* Casting from fixed point to:\n  * floating point: +/- infinity if OOR. (+ infinity in the case of uint)\n  * fixed point: when OOR, discard higher bits and reinterpret (with respect to two's complement representation for\n    signed types). For example, 200 (int16) -> -56 (int8).\n  * bool: zero to False; nonzero to True.\n* Casting from bool to:\n  * floating point: `{1.0, 0.0}`.\n  * fixed point: `{1, 0}`.\n  * bool: no change.\n",

There is no dependency condition to be met between ranks `r` and `q`\n\n2) The first `b` dimensions of the shape of `indices` tensor and `data` tensor must be equal.\n\n3) b < min(q, r) is to be honored.\n\n4) The `indices_shape[-1]` should have a value between 1 (inclusive) and rank `r-b` (inclusive)\n\n5) All values in `indices` are expected to be within bounds [-s, s-1] along axis of size `s` (i.e.) `-data_shape[i] <= indices[...,i] <= data_shape[i] - 1`.\n   It is an error if any of the index values are out of bounds.\n\nThe output is computed as follows:\n\nThe output tensor is obtained by mapping each index-tuple in the `indices` tensor to the corresponding slice of the input `data`.\n\n1) If `indices_shape[-1] > r-b` => error condition\n\n2) If `indices_shape[-1] == r-b`, since the rank of `indices` is `q`, `indices` can be thought of as `N` `(q-b-1)`-dimensional tensors\n   containing 1-D tensors of dimension `r-b`, where `N` is an integer equals to the product of 1 and all the elements in the batch dimensions\n   of the indices_shape. Let us think of each such `r-b` ranked tensor as `indices_slice`. Each *scalar value* corresponding to `data[0:b-1,indices_slice]`\n   is filled into the corresponding location of the `(q-b-1)`-dimensional tensor to form the `output` tensor (Example 1 below)\n\n3) If `indices_shape[-1] < r-b`, since the rank of `indices` is `q`, `indices` can be thought of as `N` `(q-b-1)`-dimensional tensor\n   containing 1-D tensors of dimension `< r-b`.

Input tensor I is typically the second output of the MaxPool op.\n The third (optional) input is a tensor that specifies the output size of the unpooling operation.\n\nMaxUnpool is intended to do 'partial' inverse of the MaxPool op.

Pooling\n the result of an unpooling operation should give back the original input to the unpooling op.\n\nMaxUnpool can produce the same output size for several input sizes, which makes unpooling op ambiguous.\n The third input argument, output_size, is meant to disambiguate the op and produce output tensor of\n known/predictable size.\n\nIn addition to the inputs, MaxUnpool takes three attributes, namely kernel_shape, strides, and pads,\n which define the exact unpooling op.

        "description": "\nScatterND takes three inputs `data` tensor of rank r >= 1, `indices` tensor of rank q >= 1,\nand `updates` tensor of rank q + r - indices.shape[-1] - 1. The output of the operation\nis produced by creating a copy of the input `data`, and then updating its value to values\nspecified by `updates` at specific index positions specified by `indices`. Its output shape\nis the same as the shape of `data`. Note that `indices` should not have duplicate entries.\nThat is, two or more `updates` for the same index-location is not supported.\n\n`indices` is an integer tensor. Let k denote indices.shape[-1], the last dimension in the shape of `indices`.\n `indices` is treated as a (q-1)-dimensional tensor of k-tuples, where each k-tuple is a partial-index into `data`.\nHence, k can be a value at most the rank of `data`. When k equals rank(data), each update entry specifies an\nupdate to a single element of the tensor. When k is less than rank(data) each update entry specifies an\nupdate to a slice of the tensor. Index values are allowed to be negative, as per the usual\nconvention for counting backwards from the end, but are expected in the valid range.\n\n`updates` is treated as a (q-1)-dimensional tensor of replacement-slice-values. Thus, the\nfirst (q-1) dimensions of updates.shape must match the first (q-1) dimensions of indices.shape.\nThe remaining dimensions of `updates` correspond to the dimensions of the\nreplacement-slice-values. Each replacement-slice-value is a (r-k) dimensional tensor,\ncorresponding to the trailing (r-k) dimensions of `data`.  Thus, the shape of `updates`\nmust equal indices.shape[0:q-1] ++ data.shape[k:r-1], where ++ denotes the concatenation\nof shapes.\n\nThe `output` is calculated via the following equation:\n\n    output = np.copy(data)\n    update_indices = indices.shape[:-1]\n    for idx in np.ndindex(update_indices):\n        output[indices[idx]] = updates[idx]\n\nThe order of iteration in the above loop is not specified.\nIn particular, indices should not have duplicate entries: that is, if idx1 != idx2, then indices[idx1] != indices[idx2].\nThis ensures that the output value does not depend on the iteration order.\n\nThis operator is the inverse of GatherND.\n\nExample 1:\n```\n  data    = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n  indices = [[4], [3], [1], [7]]\n  updates = [9, 10, 11, 12]\n  output  = [1, 11, 3, 10, 9, 6, 7, 12]\n```\n\nExample 2:\n```\n  data    = [[[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]],\n             [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]],\n             [[8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]],\n             [[8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]]\n  indices = [[0], [2]]\n  updates = [[[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],\n             [[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4]]]\n  output  = [[[5, 5, 5, 5], [6, 6, 6, 6], [7, 7, 7, 7], [8, 8, 8, 8]],\n             [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1]],\n             [[1, 1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2, 2], [3, 3, 3, 3], [4, 4, 4, 4]],\n             [[8, 7, 6, 5], [4, 3, 2, 1], [1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]]\n```\n",

For 1-D input, output is the n-gram representation of that input.\nFor 2-D input, the output is also a  2-D tensor whose i-th row is the n-gram representation of the i-th input row.\nMore specifically, if input shape is [C], the corresponding output shape would be [max(ngram_indexes) + 1].\nIf input shape is [N, C], this operator produces a [N, max(ngram_indexes) + 1]-tensor.\n\nIn contrast to standard n-gram extraction, here, the indexes of extracting an n-gram from the original\nsequence are not necessarily consecutive numbers. The discontinuity between indexes are controlled by the number of skips.\nIf the number of skips is 2, we should skip two tokens when scanning through the original sequence.\nLet's consider an example. Assume that input sequence is [94, 17, 36, 12, 28] and the number of skips is 2.\nThe associated 2-grams are [94, 12] and [17, 28] respectively indexed by [0, 3] and [1, 4].\nIf the number of skips becomes 0, the 2-grams generated are [94, 17], [17, 36], [36, 12], [12, 28]\nindexed by [0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], respectively.\n\nThe output vector (denoted by Y) stores the count of each n-gram;\nY[ngram_indexes[i]] indicates the times that the i-th n-gram is found. The attribute ngram_indexes is used to determine the mapping\nbetween index i and the corresponding n-gram's output coordinate. If pool_int64s is [94, 17, 17, 36], ngram_indexes is [1, 0],\nngram_counts=[0, 0], then the Y[0] (first element in Y) and Y[1] (second element in Y) are the counts of [17, 36] and [94, 17],\nrespectively. An n-gram which cannot be found in pool_strings/pool_int64s should be ignored and has no effect on the output.\nNote that we may consider all skips up to S when generating the n-grams.\n\nThe examples used above are true if mode is \"TF\". If mode is \"IDF\", all the counts larger than 1 would be truncated to 1 and\nthe i-th element in weights would be used to scale (by multiplication) the count of the i-th n-gram in pool. If mode is \"TFIDF\",\nthis operator first computes the counts of all n-grams and then scale them by the associated values in the weights attribute.\n\nOnly one of pool_strings and pool_int64s can be set. If pool_int64s is set, the input should be an integer tensor.\nIf pool_strings is set, the input must be a string tensor.\n",
