# TensorFlow to MDF

[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is a powerful and flexible open-source software library for numerical computation and data flow programming. In TensorFlow, data is represented as tensors, which are multidimensional arrays. TensorFlow allows you to define complex computation graphs with a large number of nodes (operations) connected by edges (tensors). These computation graphs can be executed on a variety of hardware platforms, including CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs.

However, it can be challenging and time-consuming to build and train complex deep learning models using TensorFlow's low-level APIs. Due to that, Keras emerged.
[Keras](https://keras.io/) serves as a frontend to TensorFlow. It was developed as a more user-friendly and higher-level API for building and training deep learning models. It provides a simple, consistent interface for building and training neural networks, which can be used to perform a variety of tasks such as image classification. See [Keras to/from MDF](Keras).
